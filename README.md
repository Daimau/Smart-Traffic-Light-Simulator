A Smart Traffic Light Simulator

This project is a physical simulation of a smart traffic light that can allocate time to itself based on the number of cars, capture red-light violations, and go to a green state if an emergency vehicle (Ambulance for demonstration) is detected.

The project is built using Python and a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B. The project is utilizing the YOLO-v4-Tiny Model, which is trained on a custom dataset for detection purposes.

It is to be noted that the Rasperry Pi 4 is being remotely accessed due to hardware limitations, where the system could run although not at a useable performance, which lead to most of the processing taking place on another device.
